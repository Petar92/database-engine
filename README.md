I have started this project to learn C++ and learn more about the inner workings of database engines.
I was inspired by [Codecrafters "Build Your Own SQLite" Challenge](https://codecrafters.io/challenges/sqlite), where I initially started the project but decided to add more of different functionalities.
I am using documentation, articles, tutorials and AI to accomplish this.
I am documenting my journey in the LessonsLearned folder where I will be uploading summaries of the challenges that I ran into, 
reading the various db documentation documents and articles and conversing with various AIs.
I am using ChatGPT to format and summarize my findings.

Approach to using AI is to ask it clarifying questions about code samples, or to lookup how certain things were implemented but not ask it to write any code for me.
