I have started this project to learn C++ and learn more about the inner workings of database engines.
I was inspired by codecrafters where I initially started the project but decided to add more of different functionalities.
I am using documentation, articles, tutorials and AI to accomplish this.
I am documenting my journey in the LessonsLearned folder where I will be uploading summaries of the challenges that I ran into, 
reading the various db documentation documents and articles and conversing with various AIs.
I am using ChatGPT to summarize my format and summarize my findings.
